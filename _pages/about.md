I am a Software Engineer at [Ververica](https://www.ververica.com/), where I work on stream processing systems that power large-scale, real-time data applications. I enjoy building systems that make data processing more intuitive, scalable, and developer-friendly; helping shape the next generation of data platforms.

I completed my PhD at TU Delft, where I worked at the intersection of stream processing and serverless computing under the supervision of [Asterios Katsifodimos](http://asterios.katsifodimos.com/). My research introduced [Styx](https://github.com/delftdata/styx), a distributed streaming dataflow engine that provides high-performance serializable transactions for stateful cloud applications. Styx aims to make microservice development easy and accessible for everyone by combining the programmability of high-level languages with the scalability and fault-tolerance of modern stream processors.

Prior to that, I obtained my MSc in Computer Science at TU Delft with a thesis on [Holistic Schema Matching at Scale](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Af4ebeda3-6465-49da-813b-f1e6e0820c60) in collaboration with ING Bank Netherlands. My first degree was a diploma (Integrated Master’s) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Technical University of Crete](https://www.tuc.gr/index.php?id=5397).
